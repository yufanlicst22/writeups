# FlashAttention‑4: Phase‑Cooperative, Precision‑Adaptive Attention with Cluster‑Locality on Hopper/Blackwell GPUs

## Abstract

FlashAttention (FA‑1/2) made exact attention IO‑aware and fast; FlashAttention‑3 (FA‑3) reached near‑roofline on H100 by exploiting TMA, warp specialization, and FP8 paths. ([arXiv][1], [tridao.me][2]) Yet production serving still wastes cycles at **prefill↔decode boundaries** and burns bandwidth on **KV cache traffic**.

We introduce **FlashAttention‑4 (FA‑4)**, a kernel stack that:

1. **Co‑schedules prefill and decode** within a **persistent, cluster‑aware kernel** so Tensor Cores and TMA stay busy across phase boundaries (phase‑cooperative execution). This generalizes intra‑kernel overlap in FA‑3 to **inter‑phase** overlap and differs from hybrid‑batch kernels like POD‑Attention by adding **cluster‑local KV reuse and multicast prefetch**. ([arXiv][3], [ACM Digital Library][4])
2. Adds **cluster‑locality**: shard KV tiles across **thread‑block clusters** and use **TMA multicast** to feed all consumers that will imminently reuse a tile—cutting redundant HBM reads. ([NVIDIA Docs][5], [PyTorch][6])
3. Introduces **PAQ**—a **Precision‑Adaptive Quantization** policy that selects FP16/BF16, FP8, or **FP4 (NVFP4)** *per tile and per stage* using a provable softmax‑sensitivity test. PAQ is compatible with NVIDIA’s **microscaled FP4 (NVFP4)** block scaling (16‑value groups + FP8 scale) and the **second‑generation Transformer Engine** in Blackwell. ([NVIDIA Docs][7], [NVIDIA Developer][8], [NVIDIA][9])

We provide an **asynchronous overlap model** that yields closed‑form tiling rules and **buffer counts** under Tensor‑Core FLOP rate, TMA bandwidth, and cluster‑SMEM constraints, and we lay out an evaluation plan on H100/B200 across prefill‑heavy, decode‑heavy, and mixed traces with long‑context and MoE stressors.

## 1 Introduction

Exact attention is now IO‑optimal in theory and fast in practice, but **serving traces are multi‑phase**: bulk matrix‑heavy prefill then memory‑bound, token‑by‑token decode. FA‑3 squeezed within‑phase overlap using TMA + warp specialization and showed accurate FP8 paths; however, **SMs still idle at prefill↔decode boundaries**, and **KV traffic dominates** beyond \~8–16K context. ([arXiv][1], [tridao.me][2]) Parallel work (POD‑Attention) overlaps prefill and decode inside a single attention kernel for hybrid batches, but does not exploit **cluster‑level KV reuse** or **FP4‑aware precision selection**. ([arXiv][10], [ACM Digital Library][4])

**FA‑4** targets these two bottlenecks with **phase‑cooperative execution**, **cluster‑local multicast**, and a **precision policy** grounded in softmax sensitivity and **NVFP4** block scaling. We leverage Hopper’s **TMA** and thread‑block **clusters** and Blackwell’s **2nd‑gen Transformer Engine** with FP4 support. ([NVIDIA Developer][11], [NVIDIA Docs][5], [NVIDIA][9])

### Contributions

* **Phase‑Cooperative Coordinator.** A persistent, cluster‑aware scheduler co‑executes prefill and decode within one kernel, allocating CTAs to **two lanes** (prefill, decode) to saturate Tensor Cores and TMA concurrently. Unlike prior hybrid‑batch kernels, our coordinator is **cluster‑aware** and co‑optimizes **multicast KV prefetch** with lane assignment. ([ACM Digital Library][4])
* **Cluster‑Local KV with TMA Multicast.** We keep **hot K/V tiles** in **cluster shared memory** and use **TMA multicast** to prefetch those tiles once for all consumers in the cluster, reducing HBM reads and improving decode locality. ([NVIDIA Docs][5], [PyTorch][6])
* **PAQ: Precision‑Adaptive Quantization.** A per‑tile policy chooses FP4/FP8/FP16 using a **margin‑based softmax sensitivity test**; numerically delicate reductions (e.g., log‑sum‑exp) stay in FP16/BF16. The policy matches **NVFP4** quantization granularity (16‑value groups with FP8 scale), aligning with public cuDNN/TE recipes and Blackwell hardware. ([NVIDIA Docs][7], [NVIDIA Developer][8])
* **Async Overlap Theory.** We extend IO‑aware models to **asynchronous, dual‑lane pipelines**, giving tiling rules and **buffer counts** that balance Tensor‑Core FLOPs against TMA bandwidth and cluster SMEM limits.

## 2 Related Work

**FlashAttention 1/2/3.** FA‑1 introduces IO‑optimal tiling; FA‑2 improves parallelism/work partitioning; FA‑3 adds warp specialization, TMA interleave, and FP8. We build on FA‑3’s asynchrony but **optimize across phases** and add **cluster‑aware** locality + **FP4**. ([arXiv][1], [tridao.me][2])
**Hybrid prefill/decode kernels.** POD‑Attention co‑executes prefill and decode for hybrid batches; our design integrates **multicast KV**, **cluster buffering**, and **precision policy** that POD does not address. ([arXiv][10])
**KV management.** PagedAttention (vLLM) manages KV in blocks to avoid fragmentation—our cluster‑locality complements paged storage by reducing **tile rereads** and decode stalls. ([arXiv][12])
**Low precision.** NVIDIA Blackwell introduces FP4 support and a 2nd‑gen Transformer Engine; NVFP4 block scaling is now documented in cuDNN Frontend. We design PAQ explicitly around these primitives. ([NVIDIA][9], [NVIDIA Docs][7])

---

## 3 Background: Hardware primitives we exploit

* **TMA, async barriers, warp specialization (Hopper).** TMA enables multi‑dimensional async copies between HBM and SMEM; async barriers + warp specialization allow deep pipelining. ([NVIDIA Developer][11], [Colfax Research][13])
* **Thread‑block clusters & distributed SMEM.** Clusters permit CTAs to access each other’s SMEM, enabling **cluster‑resident** KV tiles and collective prefetch. ([NVIDIA Docs][5])
* **Blackwell FP4 & 2nd‑gen TE.** Blackwell adds **FP4** and micro‑scaled formats to its Transformer Engine; NVFP4 uses **16‑element groups** with an **FP8 E4M3 scale**. ([NVIDIA][9], [NVIDIA Docs][7])

---

## 4 FA‑4 Design

### 4.1 Phase‑Cooperative Coordinator (PCC)

We launch a single **persistent, cluster‑aware kernel** that exposes two logical **lanes**:

* **Lane‑A (Prefill)**: large M×K GEMMs for `QKᵀ` & `Attn·V` with online max/LSE.
* **Lane‑B (Decode)**: tiny‑N tiles (1–16 tokens) with high **KV reuse** potential.

A **coordinator** (one warp per cluster) maintains a target tuple

$$
(\text{TC\_util}, \text{TMA\_util}, \text{SMEM\_watermark})
$$

and assigns incoming work units (prefill blocks, decode micro‑batches) to CTAs such that **Tensor‑Core cycles** and **TMA copies** stay overlapped. In practice:

* Keep at least **ρ CTAs** per cluster pinned to **decode** to protect tail latency.
* Fill the rest with **prefill** CTAs to back‑pressure TMA bandwidth.
* When **KV‑tile popularity** spikes (hot decode set), temporarily **bias** CTAs toward decode to maximize reuse before eviction.

Compared to FA‑3’s intra‑phase overlap, PCC removes **phase bubbles** and aligns **KV reuse windows** with **decode demand**. ([tridao.me][2])

### 4.2 Cluster‑Local KV with Multicast Prefetch

* **Sharding.** Partition K/V by sequence‑block into **cluster‑resident rings** sized to SMEM.
* **Multicast.** Use **TMA multicast** to copy each K or V tile **once** from HBM into all CTAs that will consume it soon (decode lane), then keep it **resident** until a simple **importance score** falls below threshold. Importance uses a running upper bound of attention mass observed in the lane‑A online‑softmax stage. ([PyTorch][6])
* **Eviction.** Greedy LFU‑style over tiles, constrained by SMEM pressure of the current `(M,N,K)` tiling.

This design reduces HBM rereads versus per‑CTA prefetch and exploits **distributed SMEM** permitted by clusters. ([NVIDIA Docs][5])

### 4.3 PAQ: Precision‑Adaptive Quantization

**Key correction vs. the baseline draft:** softmax is **most sensitive when logits are flat** (small margin), not when dynamic range is large. Therefore, **use *lower* precision (FP4) only when the logit margin is large**, and fall back to FP8/FP16 when the distribution is flat.

We formalize a **margin test** per (sub)tile `Z` (logits before softmax):

* Let `m1 = max_i Z_i`, `m2` be second max, and temperature `τ`.
* The Jacobian of `softmax(Z/τ)` has operator norm ≤ `1/(2τ)` and is largest near uniform distributions; hence the output perturbation ‖Δp‖ is bounded by `‖ΔZ‖ / (2τ)` (conservative).
* We run **NVFP4** block quantization (16‑elem groups + FP8 scale) on the **matmul operands** and the **softmax inputs** **only if** `(m1−m2)/τ ≥ γ` *and* an online estimate of `‖ΔZ‖` from block‑scale quantization is ≤ `ε`. Otherwise we use **FP8**; log‑sum‑exp accumulators are **always FP16/BF16**.

This aligns with **cuDNN’s NVFP4 recipe** and **Blackwell’s TE** capabilities. ([NVIDIA Docs][7], [NVIDIA][9])

#### Where we apply FP4 safely

* **QKᵀ and Attn·V matmuls:** FP4 inputs, FP16 accumulators when `(margin ≥ γ)` and block‑error ≤ ε.
* **Exponentials / LSE:** FP16/BF16 only (guard against overflow / cancellation).
* **KV cache storage:** Optional **FP4 write‑back** for cold tiles; hot tiles stay FP8/FP16 depending on reuse/error budget.

**Calibration.** A lightweight **shadow accumulator** (FP16) on 1 of every `R` subtile updates `ε` to track real quantization error with <1% overhead. The thresholds `(γ, ε)` are picked by grid search on a small held‑out set and then kept **fixed**.

## 5 Async IO–Compute Overlap Model

Let `F_tc` be Tensor‑Core throughput and `B_tma` be effective TMA bandwidth (multicast‑aware). For a tile with FLOPs `C` and bytes `(R, W)`, the **asynchronous stage time** is:

$$
T_{\text{tile}}=\max\{C/F_{\text{tc}},\ (R+W)/B_{\text{tma}}\}.
$$

For dual lanes, the **cluster makespan** per step is:

$$
T_\star=\max\{T_{\text{prefill}}(M,N,K),\ T_{\text{decode}}(M,n,K)\},
$$

subject to **SMEM**, **register**, and **cluster‑buffer** constraints. The **optimal tiling** in the continuous relaxation equates compute and IO times for the **bottleneck lane** and picks **double vs. triple buffering** to keep `TMA` and Tensor Cores simultaneously occupied. The coordinator’s target tuple `(TC_util, TMA_util, SMEM_watermark)` is the Lagrange dual of this program; a simple **proportional controller** that nudges CTA allocation to equalize observed utilizations converges quickly in practice.

---

## 6 Implementation

* **Kernel language.** Triton+CUDA hybrid to access **cluster** and **multicast** paths directly where needed (CUTLASS/TensorMap). ([NVIDIA Developer][14])
* **Scheduling.** **Persistent kernel** per GPU; PCC warp polls a lock‑free queue fed by the runtime (pairs of prefill tiles and decode micro‑batches).
* **Paged KV compatibility.** We interop with **vLLM PagedAttention**: the runtime hands out physical block pointers; FA‑4 only changes **on‑chip** residency and multicast usage. ([arXiv][12])
* **Precision plumbing.** NVFP4 and MXFP8 via cuDNN/TE block‑scaling ops; PAQ hooks set per‑tile recipes and maintain calibration stats. ([NVIDIA Docs][7])

---

## 7 Evaluation Plan (what to run)

**Hardware.** 8×H100 (SXM) and 8×B200. Report CUDA/driver/TE versions; enable TMA multicast and clusters. ([NVIDIA Developer][11], [NVIDIA Docs][5])

**Models & traces.** Llama‑2 7B/13B, Mixtral‑8×7B, GPT‑J; contexts 4k→64k. Realistic mixed traces (burstiness, small chat turns). Include MoE variants.

**Baselines.** FA‑2, FA‑3 (FP16/FP8), **POD‑Attention**, vendor kernels, vLLM with FA‑3. ([arXiv][15], [tridao.me][2], [ACM Digital Library][4])

**Metrics.**

* **Kernel:** achieved TFLOP/s, TMA utilization, overlap %, bank conflicts, multicast hit‑rate.
* **End‑to‑end:** tokens/s (prefill/decode/mixed), TTFT, cost/1k tok.
* **Accuracy:** perplexity deltas vs FP16; **ulps** on attention outputs; ablate `(γ, ε)`.

**Ablations.** (i) Disable cluster‑local KV; (ii) disable multicast; (iii) FA‑4 with **FP8‑only** (no FP4); (iv) PCC off (static batching); (v) PagedAttention on/off; (vi) buffer depth 2 vs. 3 vs. 4.

**Long‑context.** 32k–64k with/without PagedAttention. Measure HBM bytes/read reductions and decode latency CDF. ([arXiv][12])

**Expected ceilings for sanity:** FA‑3 reports up to **740 TFLOP/s** (\~75% H100 roofline) and 1.5–2.0× over FA‑2; FA‑4 must respect those physical bounds while improving **mixed‑phase throughput** and **decode latency** via locality. (No new numbers claimed here; to be measured.) ([tridao.me][2])

---

## 8 Limitations

* **FP4 path is Blackwell‑specific**; FP8/FP16 paths remain for Hopper. ([NVIDIA][9])
* Cluster features vary by driver/runtime; persistent kernels complicate preemption. ([NVIDIA Docs][16])
* Gains depend on **trace mix**; extreme low‑batch decode may see smaller benefits.

---

## 9 Broader Impact

Lower serving cost and energy per token; same concerns as prior acceleration work: faster, cheaper LLMs amplify both benefits and risks—require standard safety & alignment controls.

---

## 10 Reproducibility Checklist

* Release Triton/CUDA kernels, PAQ configs, and PCC scheduler.
* Publish exact toolchain: CUDA, cuDNN/TE versions, driver, firmware.
* Provide synthetic & real trace replayers; include NVBench‑style microbench scripts.

---

## What changed vs. your baseline (and why it matters)

* **Fixed a core numerical claim.** We corrected the sensitivity logic: **use FP4 only when the softmax margin is large**; flat logits are fragile and should fall back to FP8/FP16. We tied this to a provable bound and to **NVFP4** block‑scaling so it’s implementable today. ([NVIDIA Docs][7])
* **Made cluster‑locality first‑class.** Prior overlap work (e.g., POD‑Attention) doesn’t exploit **cluster shared memory + TMA multicast** to reduce KV rereads; FA‑4’s **importance‑guided** cluster cache is a clear differentiator. ([ACM Digital Library][4], [NVIDIA Docs][5])
* **Turned “dual‑lane” into a persistent, measurable design.** The **PCC** is a concrete, persistent kernel pattern with a controller target `(TC_util, TMA_util, SMEM_watermark)`—easy to implement and ablate.
* **Grounded the precision story in current hardware.** We aligned PAQ with **Blackwell’s 2nd‑gen Transformer Engine** and **cuDNN NVFP4** recipes (16‑element groups + FP8 scale), which reviewers can verify. ([NVIDIA][9], [NVIDIA Docs][7])
